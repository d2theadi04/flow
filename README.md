# Flow Project
Flow is a UX/UI project I designed to support women in tracking their menstrual cycle, understanding their health, and communicating with doctors in a safe and accessible way.
The app includes two user perspectives — one for patients and one for doctors — designed to streamline health monitoring and improve clarity during consultations.
This project reflects my interest in user-centered design, especially when working with sensitive information and diverse user needs.

Project Overview:
Role: UX/UI Designer
Timeline: July 2025 – September 2025
Tools: Figma
Focus Areas:
-User flows
-Mobile UI design
-Information hierarchy
-Usability and accessibility
-Privacy-aware design
Flow was created with the goal of making health tracking simple, trustworthy, and empathetic. The challenge was designing an interface that feels supportive, respectful, and easy to use for users with different health literacy levels.

Problem Statement
Women often struggle with:
-inconsistent cycle tracking
-fragmented health information
-difficulty preparing accurate details for medical visits
-uncomfortable or unclear communication during consultations
Doctors, on the other hand, lack an organized, patient-submitted overview that is easy to read quickly during appointments.
Flow addresses both by providing:
-a clean, intuitive app for users
-a structured review screen for doctors

Design Goals:
-Make health data easy to input and interpret.
-Reduce anxiety by using warm, non-clinical visual language.
-Support quick doctor review through clear information hierarchy.
-Ensure privacy with minimal, intentional data collection.
-Design an interface accessible to various ages and digital skill levels.

Design Process:
1. Understanding User Needs
I began by identifying key scenarios:
-tracking symptoms
-checking cycle predictions
-preparing for appointments
-reviewing patient notes
Key insights guided the design:
-Users prefer simple, low-effort data entry
-Doctors prefer high-level summaries first, details later
-Privacy and clarity must be consistent across screens

2. User Flow Mapping
I mapped separate flows for:
Patient: track cycle → log symptoms → view insights
Doctor: open patient → review summary → view detailed logs
This helped identify the minimum steps required to complete each task smoothly.

3. Wireframes & Layout:
I created low-fidelity wireframes focusing on:
-predictable navigation
-minimalistic cards
-readable spacing
-clear primary actions
Wireframes helped validate structure before refining visuals.

4. Visual Design:
The final UI uses:
-gentle color tones
-rounded shapes
-clear typography
-strong contrast for readability
-icons to reduce cognitive load
Complex medical information is broken into small sections, making it less overwhelming.

What I Learned:
-How to design for sensitive, personal user scenarios
-The importance of information hierarchy when supporting doctors
-How UX decisions change when you consider two user perspectives
-How to simplify complex flows without losing clarity
-The role of accessibility and privacy in health tech.

Summary:
Flow is a project that strengthened my confidence in UX/UI design.
It challenged me to balance empathy, clarity, and structure — and it showed me how thoughtful design can help users feel more supported in their everyday life.
This project represents the kind of design work I want to continue building:
experiences that simplify complexity, respect the user, and deliver real impact.
