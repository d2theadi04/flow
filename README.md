# Flow Project
Flow is a UX/UI project I designed to support women in tracking their menstrual cycle, understanding their health, and communicating with doctors in a safe and accessible way.
The app includes two user perspectives — one for patients and one for doctors — designed to streamline health monitoring and improve clarity during consultations.
This project reflects my interest in user-centered design, especially when working with sensitive information and diverse user needs.
